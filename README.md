# cyan-alias: aliasing all the aliases
`cyan-alias` is a program designed to make it easier to organize and keep track of files in the case that the actual filesystem can't be changed to suit this purpose. It does this by preprocessing system commands with file aliases in them to replace the aliases with filesystem paths before sending the command through to the system.

Actually, as of yet it doesn't do aything, but that's the general plan. Plus other stuff. Also there's probably already another utility that does this much better, but... eh, this is halfway for fun anyway. :sunglasses:
